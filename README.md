## Project
Our [advanced] project is ment top be a two player battle-simluator for a "dumbed down" version of the first generation of Pokémon games. Our project is – in essance – supposed to host a collection of Pokémon (of our own making) to choose from as well as a fully functional (though far simpler) version of the battle system found in the Pokémon-series.

### Work
#### Samuel:
* Did most of the logic work. Including planing, writing and balancing.
* Wrote the first version of the sprite drawing function.

#### Axel:
* Did most of the work on the graphics driver.
* Alterd logic code to utilize more pointers.

### Status
#### Project finished
The project is finished but could be inproved in slight ways. More Pokémon could be added along with more moves. 
Even though the memory management is more than adequate, changes could be made to give slight improvements.

#### Project accepted as an advanced project
The project was presented and passed as an advnaced project! :D

#### Known issues
- [ ] Sometimes HP goes out of bounds or becomes a random collection of symbols
- [ ] Sometimes the second move on the first turn doesn't process or animate
- [x] Input is sometimes not as responsive as wanted
